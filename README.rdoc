    git clone https://github.com/akretion/ak-prestashop.git
    
Then go in the ak-prestashop directory and launch and install the VM :

    vagrant up

= Usage

Prestashop runs on http://localhost:10100

First run you will need to configure Prestashop so go to http://localhost:10100/install-dev/index.php and start the installation workflow. In order to complete the workflow, you'll need the root password for the Mysql server : +admin25+

Once you've finished the installation workflow, the link to the administration backoffice is wrong. You should use this one : http://localhost:10100/admin-dev/index.php


PHPMyAdmin runs on http://localhost:10200

    login: root
    password: admin25
